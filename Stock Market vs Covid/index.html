                <h1>The impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Airline Stocks</h1>
                <div id="stockchart">
                </div>
                <p> The above chart was created to showcase the airline stock data for the top 6 United States based
                    airline companies. The stock data was collected from January 2018- December 2020, in order to
                    compare any changes in previous years to the Covid-19 Pandemic.</p>

                <p> To utilize this graph, you can double click on an individual airline from the legend on the right
                    hand side to showcase only that airlines data or you can single click to remove and add individual
                    airline data back to the chart. Hovering over the lines will reveal open, high, low, and closing
                    price for each date and each airline. The top left hand side of the chart includes 3 buttons to
                    select 1
                    month, 6 months, or All dates. You can also adjust the view using the slider below.</p>

                <p> Based on the data, it can be confirmed that the declaration of the pandemic in March had a quick,
                    severe effect on the airline industry. As travel restrictions have changed over the course of 2020,
                    there has been a slight increase in stock prices but there still has not been a full recovery.</p>
