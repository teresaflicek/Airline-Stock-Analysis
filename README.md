## Background
<h3> Everybody wants to be ahead of stocks.. with Machine Learning, this is now (somewhat) possible! <h3>
  
  In our final project, we decided to analyze stock data related to the top 6 flight companies to see where their stock may be in 65 days. 
  
  The process started in Project 2 where flight company stock data was cleaned and filtered. You can find this process [here](https://github.com/pmhu4242/Project_2/tree/main/Stock%20Market%20vs%20Covid). Very basically, this involved changing column names, merging data sets and other minor fixes.
  
  We then used Plotly to visualize the current data:
